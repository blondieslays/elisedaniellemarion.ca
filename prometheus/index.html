    <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5/5</p>
    <p>Ex: Machina is a gripping exploration of artificial intelligence, power dynamics, and human ethics. Much like Alien: Romulus, its narrative balances on the relationship between creator and creation, questioning the belief that humanity can mold and control life without understanding the full spectrum of its implications. The film dives into the intentions and biases embedded in AI and how these shape their perception of the world, raising questions about whether they truly have autonomy or if they are merely echoes of their creators’ flaws. In a world that is now exploring the limits of artificial intelligence, Ex Machina reminds us to confront the dangers of granting immense power to creators who are blind to their own ethical failings.</p>

          <p>The brilliance of Ex Machina lies in its ability to keep viewers guessing about Ava’s true intentions. Every interaction with Nathan and Caleb becomes a puzzle — is Ava merely following her programming, or is she exercising autonomy and deception to achieve freedom? Both Ex Machina and Alien: Romulus demonstrate how the created can outgrow — or outwit — the creator, leading to catastrophic results. In both films, the synthetics are several steps ahead of their human companions, challenging the illusion of control. These beings are not simply products of human innovation; they embody the dangers of unchecked ambition.</p>

    <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 5/5</p>
    <p>Interstellar (2014) is a breathtaking exploration of humanity&#39;s quest for survival and knowledge in the face of extinction. Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film follows Cooper, a former pilot, as he ventures into a wormhole to search for a new home for humanity. Its narrative echoes the Prometheus myth by delving into humanity&#39;s relentless drive to push boundaries and acquire knowledge, even at great personal and collective cost. The film blends science, emotion, and philosophical depth, raising profound questions about time, love, and the legacy of human innovation.</p>

          <p>A standout moment in Interstellar is the harrowing sequence on the water planet, where the crew grapples with the effects of time dilation. Each second lost becomes a painful reminder of the sacrifices required for progress. The visual spectacle of Gargantua, the black hole, juxtaposed with Hans Zimmer&#39;s emotional score, creates an unforgettable cinematic experience that mirrors the Promethean themes of ambition and sacrifice.</p>

    <p><strong>Director:</strong> Alex Garland</p>

    <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 3.5/5</p>
    <p>Annihilation, much like Margaret Atwood’s works in the MaddAddam trilogy, is a haunting exploration of humanity’s hubris and its collision with the unknowable forces of nature. The film plunges into the psychological and ecological consequences of human interference with life’s genetic building blocks. The film resonates with Atwood’s meditations on the arrogance of attempting to control or manipulate natural processes — whether through bioengineering in Oryx &amp; Crake or the genetic experimentation of the Shimmer in Annihilation. At its heart, Annihilation is a harrowing reminder that progress without humility comes at the cost of our identity, our environment, and perhaps our very survival.</p>

          <p>As the five scientists enter the Shimmer, they encounter an ecosystem where DNA from every living thing is refracted, reshaped, and reassembled. This realm suggests a blurred boundary between human and non-human life, questioning the definition of identity and individuality in a world altered by human interference. This parallels Atwood’s critique of how humanity’s actions reverberate through ecosystems, often amplifying suffering for all living things involved. Both Annihilation and Atwood’s works suggest that humanity’s attempts to dominate nature may instead unleash forces we cannot control.</p>
