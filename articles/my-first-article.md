There is an artificial intelligence (AI) trust gap within business: we are often afraid of the potential AI holds because we don’t fully understand it. The reality is, we just don’t know what we can do with AI yet; we can’t quite put it into perspective. We need to learn how to use this new tool effectively before we can apply it strategically.

_This phenomenon is not new, but it will be newly accelerated._ - Sam Altman, *The Intelligence Age*
