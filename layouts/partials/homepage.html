        <p>Hi! I’m Elise, a content strategist and self-proclaimed movie buff.</p>
        <p>“Small things have big beginnings” — a lesson I’ve embraced throughout my career, which began as an English teacher in South Korea. My journey led me to Dublin for a Masters in Comparative Literature, where I explored identity and intertextuality in my dissertation.</p>
        <p>My writing gained new depth after my adult ADHD diagnosis in Fall 2024, a journey of self-exploration and neurodivergence shared by many. This discovery has propelled me to understand my mind’s unique workings through different applications, including learning and storytelling.</p>
