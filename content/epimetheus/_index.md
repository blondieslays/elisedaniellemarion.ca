    text: >
      Alien: Romulus marks a striking shift in tone for the franchise, delivering a grim and introspective take on humanityâ€™s future.

      At its heart, Romulus examines the ethical dilemmas of technological evolution, questioning the balance between innovation and control.

      Where previous installments emphasized survival, Romulus focuses on the moral and ethical implications of creation. Alvarez ensures the franchise remains relevant, balancing its philosophical depth with visceral horror.
