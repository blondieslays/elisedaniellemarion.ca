description: "Welcome to Pandora.
Zeus built her as part of his plan to punish Prometheus for the gift
of fire. Zeus gave Pandora a jar filled with all the evils of the world.
Although instructed not to open it, Pandora was curious. When she peeked
inside, she released the evils into the world; leaving only hope inside."
