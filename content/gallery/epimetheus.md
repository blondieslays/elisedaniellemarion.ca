description: "Welcome to Epimetheus.
Epimetheus, the brother of Prometheus, was tasked with giving gifts to the
creatures of the Earth. However, in his impulsiveness, he gave the best 
attributes—speed, strength, and cunning—to the animals, leaving humans
defenseless. His lack of foresight left humanity vulnerable, forcing Prometheus
to intervene by giving mankind the gift of fire."
