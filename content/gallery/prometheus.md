description: "Welcome to Prometheus.
Prometheus, a Titan, defied Zeus by stealing fire and gifting it to humanity,
enabling mankind to progress and thrive. His act of rebellion against the gods
brought light and knowledge to the world, but it also incurred Zeus' wrath.
As punishment, Prometheus was bound to a rock, enduring eternal torment 
for his compassion toward humanity."
