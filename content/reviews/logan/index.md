review: "*Logan* is a visceral, emotionally charged meditation on legacy, mortality, and redeption, set against the backdrop of a world that has seemingly left heroes behind. Stripped of the grandiosity of traditional superhero tales, *Logan* embraces raw human vulnerability, presenting an aging Wolverine grappling with his own decline while protecting a young mutant, Laura, from sinister forces. The film delves into questions of identity and responsibility — juxtaposing the brutality of humanity’s actions with the enduring power of hope, connection, and sacrifice — themes that echo throughout the entire *X-Men* franchise."
highlights: "The final act of *Logan* is a devastating yet cathartic culmination of its themes. Logan’s sacrifice to save Laura is not just a physical act but a moment of redemption, as he confronts his legacy and chooses to pass on hope to a new generation. This mirrors the intergenerational struggles seen in *The Last Of Us*, where the journey is as much about finding purpose as it is about survival. The film strips away distractions to focus on the humanity of its characters, becoming a reflection on the cost of redemption and the legacies we leave behind."
