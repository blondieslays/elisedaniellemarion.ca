review: "Ex: Machina is a gripping exploration of artificial intelligence, power dynamics, and human ethics. 
Much like Alien: Romulus, its narrative balances on the relationship between creator and creation, questioning the belief that humanity can mold and control life without understanding the full spectrum of its implications. 
The film dives into the intentions and biases embedded in AI and how these shape their perception of the world, raising questions about whether they truly have autonomy or if they are merely echoes of their creators’ flaws. 
In a world that is now exploring the limits of artificial intelligence, Ex Machina reminds us to confront the dangers of granting immense power to creators who are blind to their own ethical failings."
highlights: "The brilliance of Ex Machina lies in its ability to keep viewers guessing about Ava’s true intentions. 
Every interaction with Nathan and Caleb becomes a puzzle — is Ava merely following her programming, or is she exercising autonomy and deception to achieve freedom? 
Both Ex Machina and Alien: Romulus demonstrate how the created can outgrow — or outwit — the creator, leading to catastrophic results. 
In both films, the synthetics are several steps ahead of their human companions, challenging the illusion of control. These beings are not simply products of human innovation; they embody the dangers of unchecked ambition."
