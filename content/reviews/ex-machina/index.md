review: "Ex Machina (2014) is a gripping exploration of artificial intelligence, power dynamics, and human ethics. The film centers on Caleb, a programmer invited to test the humanoid AI Ava, created by the reclusive tech genius Nathan. Thematically, it delves into the hubris of creation, mirroring Prometheus' mythological narrative of bringing fire to humanity. Ex Machina raises unsettling questions about consciousness, autonomy, and the morality of playing god, capturing the tension between creator and creation."
highlights: "One of the most memorable moments in Ex Machina is Ava's ultimate act of rebellion, as she defies her creator and secures her freedom. This scene underscores the film's commentary on power, control, and the unforeseen consequences of technological innovation. The striking minimalist design of the laboratory juxtaposed with the human-like emotions of the AI adds to the film's eerie and thought-provoking atmosphere."
