review: "*It’s What’s Inside* is a kaleidoscopic exploration of identity, ethics, and the human condition, wrapped in a horror-whodunit that keeps you circling back for more. The Netflix film dives into the consequences of separating physical form from identity, a haunting reflection on modern developments in AI and biogenetics. The central question — what remains of “you” when your physical form no longer anchors your identity — calls to mind *The Matrix* and *Black Mirror* episodes like “San Junipero”, which interrogate the intersection of consciousness and body."
highlights: "Through its dazzling use of RGB colour theory, the film layers its story visually, using shifting filters to reveal how characters see each other and themselves — a subtle but striking commentary on the fractured ways we perceive identity. In the end, the protagonist is left asking whether they can still claim to be the same person after such a profound transformation. With its philosophical depth and striking visual style, *It's What's Inside* ultimately asks: what does it mean to be human when identity becomes fluid, fragmented, and even optional?"
