review: "It's What's Inside (2024) is a kaleidoscopic exploration of identity, ethics, and the human condition, wrapped in a horror-whodunit that keeps you circling back for more.
Thematically, the film dives into the consequences of separating physical form from identity, a haunting reflection on modern developments in AI and biogenetics. Through its dazzling use of RGB color theory, the film layers its story visually, using shifting filters to reveal how characters see each other and themselves—a subtle but striking commentary on the fractured ways we perceive identity.
With its philosophical depth and striking visual style, It's What's Inside asks: What does it mean to be human when identity becomes fluid, fragmented, and even optional?"
highlights: "The climax of It's What's Inside highlights the devastating choice of one character to relinquish their original body for the promise of freedom—a choice that serves as both liberation and ultimate loss.
The film’s narrative thrives on looping perspectives and dynamic camera work, creating a tapestry of shifting truths. The way the film’s central mystery unfolds forces viewers to question not just who did it, but who they really are."
