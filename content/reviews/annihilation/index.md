review: "Annihilation (2018), much like Margaret Atwood’s works in the MaddAddam Trilogy, is a haunting exploration of humanity’s hubris and its collision with the unknowable forces of nature. The film plunges into the psychological and ecological consequences of human interference with life’s building blocks. 
Thematically, the film resonates with Atwood’s meditations on the arrogance of attempting to control or manipulate natural processes—whether through bioengineering in Oryx and Crake or the genetic experimentation of the Shimmer in Annihilation.
At its heart, Annihilation is a harrowing reminder that progress without humility comes at the cost of our identity, our environment, and perhaps our very survival."
highlights: "One of the most striking moments in Annihilation occurs when the team encounters the mutated bear—a chilling representation of nature’s brutal response to human interference. This echoes Atwood’s theme of unintended consequences when humanity tampers with natural ecosystems. 
Another pivotal moment, the surreal and transformative climax in the lighthouse, mirrors Atwood’s exploration of human identity and transformation, where boundaries between self and other dissolve in the face of ecological collapse."
