review: "*Annihilation*, much like **Margaret Atwood’s *MaddAddam* trilogy**, is a haunting exploration of **humanity’s hubris** and its collision with the unknowable forces of nature. The film plunges into the psychological and ecological consequences of **human interference** with **life’s genetic building blocks**. It resonates with Atwood’s meditations on the arrogance of attempting to control or **manipulate natural processes** — whether through bioengineering in *Oryx & Crake* or the genetic experimentation of the Shimmer in *Annihilation*. At its heart, *Annihilation* is a harrowing reminder that **progress without humility** comes at the **cost of our identity, our environment**, and perhaps our very survival."
highlights: "As the five scientists enter the Shimmer, they encounter an ecosystem where DNA from every living thing is **refracted, reshaped, and reassembled**. This realm suggests a blurred boundary between **human and non-human life**, questioning the definition of identity and individuality in a world altered by human interference. This parallels Atwood’s critique of how humanity’s actions **reverberate through ecosystems**, often amplifying suffering for all living things involved. Both *Annihilation* and Atwood’s works suggest that humanity’s attempts to **dominate nature** may instead **unleash forces we cannot control**."
