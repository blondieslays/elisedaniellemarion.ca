review: "*Alien: Romulus* offers a grim and unsettling vision of space colonization, with a tone that feels more introspective and morally ambiguous. Unlike the aspirational journey of *Interstellar*, *Romulus* delves deep into the consequences of technological evolution, exploring the ethical tension between innovation and control. While the Alien franchise has always examined humanity’s reckless curiosity, *Romulus* ventures further, asking a haunting question: what happens when the lines between creator and creation blurs beyond recognition?"
highlights: "Actor David Jonsson brilliantly reflects the calculated yet evolving consciousness of synthetic beings as they navigate the human-dominated world around them. His dynamic with his sister Rain pushes past the familiar boundaries of synthetic and human relationships in the *Alien* franchise. What they see, and what their human companions do, drives these synthetic beings to tip the balance of power enough to tile the humans off their moral axis. Whereas previous *Alien* entries emphasized survival, *Romulus* sharpens its focus on the ethical dilemmas of control and dependence."
