review: "*Alien: Romulus* offers a grim and unsettling vision of space colonization, adopting a tone that feels more introspective and morally ambiguous than its predecessors. Unlike the aspirational journey of *Interstellar*, *Romulus* delves deep into the consequences of technological evolution, exploring the ethical tension between innovation and control. While the *Alien* franchise has always examined humanity’s reckless curiosity, *Romulus* ventures further, asking a haunting question: what happens when the lines between creator and creation blurs beyond recognition?"
highlights: "Actor David Jonsson brilliantly portrays the calculated yet evolving consciousness of synthetic beings as they navigate a human-dominated world. His dynamic with his sister Rain transcends the familiar boundaries of synthetic-human relationships seen in the *Alien* franchise, offering a fresh exploration of connection and conflict. Their observations of human actions — and the consequences of those actions — drive these synthetics to shift the balance of power, challenging the moral foundations of their human counterparts. While earlier *Alien* films centered on survival, *Romulus* delves deeper, examining the ethical dilemmas of control, dependence, and the fragility of moral order."
