review: "Alien: Romulus sets a vastly different tone from its predecessors, offering a grim and unsettling vision of humanity's future with space colonization. 
Thematically, Romulus tackles the consequences of technological evolution, particularly the ethical balance between innovation and control. 
The Alien franchise has always explored humanity's reckless curiosity, but Romulus takes these ideas further by asking: what happens when the lines between creator and creation blurs beyond recognition?"
highlights: "Actor David Jonsson brilliantly reflects the thoughtful calculations that synthetics make as they experience the world around them. 
What they see, and what their human companions do, drive these synthetic beings to tip the balance of power enough to tilt the humans off their moral axis. 
We are now feeding content to AI systems, directing them with little consideration for long-term consequences. 
Whereas previous Alien entries emphasized survival, Romulus sharpens its focus on the ethical dilemmas of control and dependence."
