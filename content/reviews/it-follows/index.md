review: "It Follows (2014) is a chilling exploration of consequences and the lingering impact of past actions. The film follows Jay, a teenager pursued by a supernatural entity transmitted through intimate encounters. Thematically, it mirrors Epimetheus by highlighting the burden of choices and their aftermath, wrapped in a creeping dread that lingers long after the credits roll."
highlights: "The unnerving simplicity of the entity’s slow, relentless pursuit is one of the film’s most memorable aspects, serving as a metaphor for the inescapable weight of consequence. Its retro soundtrack and minimalist cinematography enhance the atmosphere, crafting a haunting tale of inevitability and regret."
