review: "*It Follows* transcends the conventions of horror to become a haunting exploration of consequence, mortality, and the inescapable nature of fear. At its core, the film examines the lingering impact of choices, suggesting that our past decisions (the “it”) will inevitably catch up with us. “It’s” relentless pursuit becomes a chilling metaphor for the burdens we inherit and pass on, wrapped in a narrative full of psychological tension. *It Follows* delves deeply into the ethics of leadership and survival, as Jay (Maika Monroe) must navigate her responsibility to herself and others while facing an invisible threat."
highlights: "The film’s unnerving simplicity — an entity that walks at a steady, unrelenting pace — evokes the inevitability of death and the weight of consequence. The entity’s rules force Jay into morally ambiguous territory, as her survival depends on choices that could harm others. This mirrors leadership in crisis: the struggle to make hard choices that may preserve some while sacrificing others. Ultimately, *It Follows* challenges viewers to confront the lingering specters of their own past decisions, while questioning the lengths we’ll go to outrun the inescapable. It’s a testament to the genre’s ability to terrify not just with what’s seen, but with what lies in the recesses of our collective fears."
