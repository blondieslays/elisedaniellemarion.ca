review: "*Interstellar* is not just a story of intergalactic exploration but a profound ***meditation on leadership, sacrifice**, and the burden of revealing truths that humanity may not be ready to face. Cooper’s desperate escape from Gargantua — where every passing second robs him of decades with his family — underscores the **clash between selflessness and personal sacrifice**. Like *Alien: Romulus*, *Interstellar* delves into the **choices that leaders make** when the stakes are nothing less than humanity’s future."
highlights: "At the heart of *Interstellar* is the theme of **leadership in crisis**. Dr. Brand’s (Anne Hathaway) insistence on the power of love as a guiding force stands in stark contrast to the **colder pragmatism** of Dr. Mann (Matt Damon), who, like the antagonists in *Romulus*, represents the **darker side of leadership** — selfishness and manipulation **disguised as necessity**. In the end, *Interstellar* reminds us that leaders who endure the greatest sacrifices often stand at the intersection of hope and despair**, illuminating paths forward even when it **costs them everything**."
