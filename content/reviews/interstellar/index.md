review: "Interstellar (2014) is not just a story of intergalactic exploration but a profound meditation on leadership, sacrifice, and the burden of revealing truths that humanity may not be ready to face. 
Much like Lee Miller’s harrowing revelations of the Holocaust in the Kate Winslet-led biopic, Cooper emerges as a reluctant hero, torn between personal loss and the greater good. 
His desperate escape from Gargantua — where each passing second robs him of decades with his family — mirrors the sacrifices of whistleblowers, war reporters, and activists who risk everything to confront humanity with the harsh realities it must reckon with."
highlights: "At the heart of Interstellar is the theme of leadership in crisis. 
Dr. Brand’s (Anne Hathaway) insistence on the power of love as a guiding force stands in stark contrast to the colder pragmatism of Dr. Mann (Matt Damon), who, like the antagonists in Alien: Romulus, represents the darker side of leadership — selfishness and manipulation disguised as necessity. 
In the end, Interstellar reminds us that leaders who endure the greatest sacrifices often stand at the intersection of hope and despair, illuminating paths forward even when it costs them everything."
