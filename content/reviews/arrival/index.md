review: "Arrival (2016) is a poignant exploration of communication, memory, and the consequences of choices. The film follows linguist Louise Banks as she deciphers the language of extraterrestrial beings, the Heptapods, who perceive time non-linearly. Thematically, Arrival aligns with Epimetheus by reflecting on the weight of decisions and their unintended outcomes. It is a meditation on humanity’s capacity to reconcile with the past while embracing the uncertainty of the future."
highlights: "One of Arrival’s most haunting moments is Louise’s realization that her actions in the present are informed by her future experiences. This revelation reframes the film's narrative, showing the beauty and tragedy of hindsight. The intricate use of the Heptapods' circular language, paired with Jóhann Jóhannsson’s ethereal score, emphasizes the interconnectedness of time, memory, and consequence."
