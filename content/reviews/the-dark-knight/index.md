review: "The Dark Knight (2008) explores chaos, morality, and the duality of human nature. With Gotham City on the brink of collapse, Bruce Wayne faces the Joker, an anarchistic force who thrives on societal destruction. The film embodies the Pandora Gallery’s themes by delving into the chaos unleashed when humanity tampers with moral boundaries, while still offering hope through the resilience of its characters."
highlights: "The interrogation scene between Batman and the Joker is a standout moment, encapsulating the film’s central themes of chaos and morality. Hans Zimmer’s pulse-pounding score and Heath Ledger’s transformative performance create a masterclass in tension and storytelling."
